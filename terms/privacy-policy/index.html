          <p>This Privacy Policy describes how MIMO collects, uses and discloses information, and what choices you have with respect to the information.</p>

          <p>When we refer to "MIMO", we mean the MIMO entity that acts as the controller or processor of your information, as explained in more detail in the "Identifying the Data Controller and Processor" section below.</p>

          <p>This Privacy Policy applies to MIMO's WiFi Marketing tools, splash pages and platform (collectively, the "Services"), OH-MIMO.com and other MIMO websites (collectively, the "Websites") and other interactions (e.g., customer service inquiries, user conferences, etc.) you may have with MIMO. If you do not agree with the terms, do not access or use the Services, Websites or any other aspect of MIMO's business.</p>

          <p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party applications or software that integrate with the Services through the MIMO platform ("Third Party Services"), or any other third party products, services or businesses. In addition, a separate agreement governs delivery, access and use of the Services (the "Customer Agreement"), including the processing of personal data (collectively, "Customer Data"). The organization (e.g., the business or location) that entered into the Customer Agreement ("Customer") controls their instance of the Services and any associated Customer Data that may be collected by way of the Splash Pages. If you have any questions about specific Service settings and privacy practices, please contact the Customer whose splash pages you use. You can check for contact information of your Dashboard owner(s) and administrator(s) via the splash pages directly.</p>

          <p>If Information is aggregated or de-identified so it is no longer reasonably associated with an identified or identifiable natural person, MIMO may use it for any business purpose. To the extent Information is associated with an identified or identifiable natural person and is protected as personal data under applicable data protection law, it is referred to in this Privacy Policy as "Personal Data."</p>

          <h3>How We Share And Disclose Information</h3>

If we receive a request for information, we may disclose Other Information if we reasonably believe disclosure is in accordance with or required by any applicable law, regulation or legal process.

          <h3>Security</h3>

These steps take into account the sensitivity of the Other Information we collect, process and store, and the current state of technology.
