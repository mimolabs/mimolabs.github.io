          <p>We built MIMO to help small businesses engage with their customers. We did not build it so they could hassle or spam their customers. At all points, we've done our best to ensure the marketing messages you may receive are positive and wanted. If you have any complaints or questions, please email team@oh-mimo.com</p>

          <p>As a marketing automation platform that delivers emails, we are required to enforce spam laws. If you're sending automated messages from MIMO, here are the requirements that you must agree to as part of the Terms of Use.</p>

            <li>There must be an unsubscribe link on all emails - we will add this for you.</li>
            <li>If a user unsubscribes - you must respect this. MIMO will not email them again - do not manually email them.</li>
            <li>When a user unsubscribes from your list, they unsubscribe from all MIMO lists.</li>
            <li>You must include your contact information inside every promotional campaign that you send, including a physical mailing address.</li>
